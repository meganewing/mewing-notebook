## Goals

As a recap – august/sept goals were:

-   ✅ Get consensus tree

-   ✅ Make gene trees *so I can run robinson foulds and identify genes of interest*

I was able to get my consensus trees and decide which one I'm going to use! I settled on the 50% coverage tree (meaning at least 50% of taxa are represented in each bait sequence) using the v1 bait file (10k mollusc UCEs). There was still some discordance among the trees, but the 50v1 tree had 1) the highest number of sequences used in tree generation and 2) had relationships most supported by literature. I also ended up with a gene tree file for each gene, so this month will be about comparing the two and starting interpretation. Thus, my goals are

-   Run Phangorn to generate tree distance (gene trees vs. consensus trees)

-   Plot tree distance matrix and identify cuttoff/threshold for genes of interest

-   Have list of genes of interest that I can start interpretation on

-   Update methods to-date

## Dailies

### Oct 1

Mostly just homework & class for pubpol. Lot of reading and had to finish a case study writeup before class.

GRFP workshop in the evening (last synchronous meeting for a bit)

### Oct 2

Thursdays are fully 311 lab days. I teach both sections (AM and PM) and there can be 30-60 min ish for prep.

Met with Isaiah (Luke's undergrad who I'm assisting with SIA work) to go over isotope sample prep

### Oct 5

311 lab material prep and publish for the week

### Oct 6

notebook update

311 planning meeting

599 reading & homework

lab meeting

599 class

511 reading & homework

### Oct 7

Office hours

511 class

599 reading & Homework

555 homework

555 class

### Oct 8 

311 grading

Meeting with Emma TS to talk about visual abstract guidelines for rphil MS

Checked and renamed tips for consensus tree. Visualized with ggtree (not a fan). Couldn't get a very 'pretty' visualization and tip names kept getting truncated but the tree relationships looked good and the taxa names in the treefile itself were what I needed (matching the gene tree). Started trial tree distance analysis using 1 gene tree to start. Seemed to get it all sorted, now just need to create it as a loop and save the outputs to a dataframe.

599 class

have a group project for 599 where we have to lead a case study so I met with my group after class to work on that

### Oct 9

full lab day

### Oct 10

short WFH day – just worked on the visual abstract

### Oct 13

311 planning meeting – longer than normal (8-11:30), but should be last lengthy lab setup

599 reading + homework

599 class

## *Next two weeks* 

10/14 - today I mostly just have class, meetings, an errand to run for 311, and some grading.

10/15 - no 599 homework! will be using pre-class time (which is basically the entire first half of the day) to work on my tree loop and get that running, class, group project meetup after class.

10/16 - lab day

10/17 - since the way my schedule has shaken out this quarter has led me to being on campus \~10hrs/day or so and then often doing more homework once I get home from campus, I'm trying to take fridays easy and reserve them for if there's any super pressing issues (like the visual abstract). My plan for 10/17 is to go rock climb :)

10/20 - 311 planning meeting, and a meeting with Marta about me guest lecturing one day this quarter for 311 – likely the lecture covering reproductive strategies. 599 stuff

10/21 - office hours, class, homework/grading/coding (as needed), class

10/22 - homework/grading/coding, class, group project meetup after class

10/23 - lab day

10/24 - will likely use this friday to catch up on some writing (proposal edits, clam chapter edits). But if it's dry and I'm caught up on homework/grading, I might sneak off to go rock climb again before the season ends for good...

10/27 -311 planning meeting, homework, class

## *Goals for meeting with Steven*

I've been starting to play with the idea of bypassing and going for the full thing. I feel like I've really settled into a good groove with all the grad school stuff (okay, except writing) and have really been enjoying working on the phylogeny chapter and TAing. I do want to get my phd eventually, and it seems like it may be a good time to just keep on going since I'm already here and I'm still at a point in my life where I have the freedom from responsibility to be in school & not have to make very much money. But I don't want to keep going just for the piece of paper at the end (even though that is definitely part of the motivation) – I would want my additional chapters to help forward some of my long term goals in terms of careers: more field work, some surveying experience maybe, some more applied science application maybe. Ideally, something incorporating ecology would be huge and I think would help me walk out as a very well rounded aquatic scientist when i graduate. But I know funding stuff is super funky right now, so I mostly want to discuss if there are even any projects possible in that realm, and what other options may be.
