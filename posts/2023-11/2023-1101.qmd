**Daily notebook updates for November**

## Nov. 1 - Gearing up for clam work

Wrapping up with blast tutorial, pushing issues, moving forward:

Finally wrapped up the blast tutorial and got through the visualization of top 10 genes, which was sick. I definitely need to refresh on how to even read the results of a blast table though, just so I have a better understanding of what things like e values mean. Next/final step in that regard is to push the repo to git hub, but didn't get around to that today since I had that issue with commiting large files and need to recreate the repo before I can re-commit and push. That will be first order of business tomorrow before lab meeting prep then lab meeting.

More on looking forward, I am about to start analysis with the clam data Mac shared. To prep for this, I spent some time today reviewing the repo and workflow I used for coho data analyses in 546 a couple years ago, to 1) refresh, 2) see what parts of the workflow I could use for this analysis, and 3) identify what things I need to improve upon in terms of reproducability (my code comments and readme docs could be better). As I continue reviewing that this week, I will start crackin' into the clam data.

## Nov. 6 - Homework and Planning

Not much lab-focused stuff today. Had class and got ahead on some assignments for the week. After that, did some planning for what to work on this week:

-   Tuesday:

    -   Create new repo for blast tutorial so I can push to github and close the issue.

    -   Start repo for clam data

    -   Update notebook format using the TOC method we talked about in lab meeting last week

-   Wednesday:

    -   Clam data work

    -   Read DEI chapter/s for lab meeting

-   Thursday

    -   Finish any remaining assignments for classes for the week (HW 1 for 553 main priority)

-   Friday
