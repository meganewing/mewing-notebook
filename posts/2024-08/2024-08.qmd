### August 7th

August goals, submitted masters committee milestone. Based off of what Mac and i discussed last week, I went back to trying different pre-filtering parameters and decided to take a different approach. Created histogram, boxplot, and generated summary stats for all of the count data to see how they were spread. We knew the rRNA was eating up a ton of the reads, so I wanted to visually see the spread a bit better, where I could ignore the rRNA interference and make a decision on what made sense as a cutoff for pre-filtering. Depending on if I set the cutoff for the histogram and boxplot counts ranging between 0-50, 0-100, 0-1000, 0-6000, or all counts, the median stayed between 20 to 30. When using all counts the median was 23.

I set the pre-filter parameters to at least 23 counts for at least 8 individuals (so, at least half) for control OR treatment group.

The control and treatment groups stayed together on the heatmap, even when clustered, which is promising.

Waiting on egg quality / mother quality data to make some sense of the samples that still seem to not show super distinct differences in expression.

### August 13th

Small day. Got the egg quality data and started to review it. Bit more info than anticipated. Also organized different degrees of "outliers" (not really outliers) of the samples that didn't have super distinct expression, based off of the clustering in the heatmap from last week to give an idea what samples to keep an eye out for when diving into the egg data.

### August 14th

Identifying patterns in egg quality data as it relates to the samples in the heatmap. But found that there wasn't enough egg quality info about the samples that are the "outliers" since not all mothers had egg quality data measured. Results inconclusive.

### August 15th

Switched to looking for patterns in read QC. ie, looking if total number of aligned reads explained any of the data in our heatmap (thinking, "maybe those with overall less reads are the ones that have less distinct expression compared to others in their treatment group"). no dice.

Colors represent the clustering of samples, where more blue shows "cooler" expression on the heatmap for the chunk of genes that are generally "hotter" in the control group. More red bars = "hotter" on the heatmap.

### August 17th

After talking to mac, going to proceed towards annotation with the latest gene list (from aug 7). Clustering looks good, pre filter parameters have sound biological reasoning, and nothing seems to be explaining the differences in expression (or lack of differences) that relates to egg or read quality.

Had an issue previously with blast not having hits for all of my genes in my DEG list, which is odd since the genome is fully annotated. Mac suggested try running with less stringent e value. Went from E-20 to E-5 which feels drastic, but I do filter out for just the hit with the best e value for each LOC, and can use bit score to confirm integrity of the results later downstream.
