As I continue to work through finding good pre filtering parameters to make a heatmap that actually clusters / results that Mac and I can feel confident in, I'm starting to think about how this will transition into a chapter. My goals then are

-   Finish fine tuning the results

-   Start write up for transcriptomics section of the MS

    -   write the methods and results for what there is so far

    -   outline intro and methods

-   Look into funding for the 2025 Aquaculture conference in late winter/early spring
