Whoops forgot to do dailys, so here's weeklys:

### May 1-4

May 9th is my assigned day to lead 541, so on top of normal class and homework stuff, I was working on gathering curriculum material

### May 5-11

More curriculum prep stuff, regular class things, and caught up on lab homework (DESeq2 w featurecounts, blast, joining, gene enrichment, etc). Also open house is next weekend so did some prep with Andy for that.

### May 12-18

Class and regularly scheduled programming. Prep for open house, with grace. Went out on a boat (admiral jack!) with Rosalind and Maritime HS. And had the open house which was sick and had over 1200 estimated visitors!

### May 19-26

Class and lab, re installed x tools to finally get my notebook updated
