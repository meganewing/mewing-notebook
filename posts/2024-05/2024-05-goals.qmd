## Nothin too fancy

Kind of abandoned my april goals as class/homework took majority of my time

May goals:

-   invite committee members (Mac, Jose, maybe Lorenz)

-   do some professional development / "broader impacts" things. (realized I'd been lacking BI after filling out the GRFP activities report)
