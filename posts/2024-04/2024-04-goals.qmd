## April Goals...well...[goal]{.underline}

-   Main goal this quarter is to get together a draft of chapter 1: on comparative physiology and transciptomics of bivalve reproductions. This includes

    -   Doing both the following approaches:

        -   Approach 1:Â 

            -   Short list of genes (query file)

                -   Look up proteins on ncbi and download faster files to use as queer file

            -   Transciptome of organism of interest (database)

            -   Use blast to see if they are present in different genomes

            Approach 2 (shotgun approach)

            -   Taking everything in species

            -   Annotating everything

            -   Sorting things based on reproduction

        So for April I'll start with 1 data set (one species) and get protocls in place, then go from there.

-   Will also be doing some sampling (april 9/10 at manchester)
