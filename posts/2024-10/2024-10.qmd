Whoops haven't updated daily posts in awhile... here's what you missed in the last 3 weeks:

-   submitted aquaculture 2025 abstract

-   had first committee meeting

-   met with individuals from NOAA, WDFW, King County, UW (both admin and profs), WSP and FHL to discuss career paths and opportunities to look out for

-   GRFP workshop mentoring!

-   got obscenely sick for a few days

Okay, here's where we are now:

### October 9th

Added some of my DEG findings and methods to a comparison chart with Giles' outputs to see if our results are consistent. Once we can confirm everything looks good, I can full deep dive with the interpretation of the results.

Last session of the GRFP workshop with the NSF style review. Really cool to see how diverse the applications are!
