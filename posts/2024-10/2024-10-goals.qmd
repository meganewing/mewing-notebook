-   Continue write up for transcriptomics section of the r.phil MS

    -   edit and update the methods and results for what there is so far

    -   outline intro and discussion

-   Review literature to write methods for thesis proposal

By mid november I want to send out my proposal and study plan to my committee, and want to send a draft of ch. 2 ideally by the end of the (calendar) year, so just trucking along towards those slightly longer term goals.
