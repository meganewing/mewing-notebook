## June Goals

-   Finish workflow for O. lurida gene identification and get 1 additional species through the work flow (probs R. Phil)

    -   "Shotgun approach"

        -   Annotate whole transcriptome

        -   Get a list of genes associated with reproduction

    -   Search approach

        -   Get a literature-based list of genes associated with reproduction

        -   Get fasta file for each gene from NCBI (query file)

        -   Blast using transcriptome of species of interest (database) to see if they are present in different organisms

-   Write up workflow

-   Form a committee
