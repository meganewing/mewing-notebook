## Goals

My goals for this month are:

-   Create and send proposal draft to committee

-   Create and send study plan draft to committee

-   Finish downstream (from deseq) analysis for r.phil

-   Update r.phil methods and results

## Daily

### Nov. 4-8th

Wanted to focus in on Ch. 1 of my proposal, since that was where the most questions were during my committee meeting. Wanted to get an idea of what my anticipated results/figures would be, thinking that would help guide the rest. This paper was particularly helpful: [**Bivalves as Emerging Model Systems to Study the Mechanisms and Evolution of Sex Determination: A Genomic Point of View**](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/15/10/evad181/7321078#421781889) **.** Notes and reflections below:

### Nov. 11-15th

Graded midterms for two classes this week. Was hoping to get some progress on the proposal draft, but had limited to no shellfish/thesis time. Got to help out with Rosalind's classes though!

### Nov. 18-20th

Finally got to start writing on proposal draft and study plan! Should be sent out around (Wednesday?)

## Self-Review on Past Two Weeks

Feel pretty good about my progress towards my monthy goals â€“ sent in proposal draft and plan of study last night. Admittedly, the proposal took longer than expected (especially the identifying sexual systems for the 16 bivalves) and got sent a couple days later than I had initially hoped.

Regarding the r.phil workflow, I've been keeping Mac in the loop with my anticipated timeline for sending updated results by the end of the month, and am on track to still have that be the case. Though the writeup for those might spill into Decemeber.

## Next Two Weeks Goals (11/21 - 12/6)

-   Update R.Phil Results

-   Update results and methods write up
