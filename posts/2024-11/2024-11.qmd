## Goals

My goals for this month are:

-   Create and send proposal draft to committee

-   Create and send study plan draft to committee

-   Finish downstream (from deseq) analysis for r.phil

-   Update r.phil methods and results

## Daily

### Nov. 4-8th

Wanted to focus in on Ch. 1 of my proposal, since that was where the most questions were during my committee meeting. Wanted to get an idea of what my anticipated results/figures would be, thinking that would help guide the rest. This paper was particularly helpful: [**Bivalves as Emerging Model Systems to Study the Mechanisms and Evolution of Sex Determination: A Genomic Point of View**](https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/15/10/evad181/7321078#421781889) **.** Notes and reflections below:

### Nov. 11-15th

Graded midterms for two classes this week. Was hoping to get some progress on the proposal draft, but had limited to no shellfish/thesis time. Got to help out with Rosalind's classes though!

### Nov. 18-20th

Finally got to start writing on proposal draft and study plan! Should be sent out around (Wednesday?)

### Nov. 21st-22nd (anticipated)

-   Revisit r.phil workflow and run blast to get GO terms for DEGs

### Nov. 25th-27th (anticipated) 

-   Add in annotation info from NCBI where no blast hits

-   Review literature and get summary list of affected biological proccesses

### Nov. 30th-31st (anticipated) 

-   update results and methods write up
