Haven’t started with the geoduck file given in the assigned github issue yet, as I wanted to make sure I could get through the workflow with the example files/links in the tutorials without issue first, before adding in another variable. Plus, I figured it would be a good opportunity to dust off the cobwebs when it comes to creating a robust and reusable script.\nI’ve made it through all the visualization steps fine so far, but have been running into issues once trying to run the actual blast. Since it’s Wednesday evening though and I won’t be working on this much longer tonight, I figured I’ll wait til lab meeting."
