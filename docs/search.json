One issue I ran into was it seemed blastx was not returning any matches. Come to find out I was running blastx on a protein sequence. Switched to blastp and all seems to be going alright. Still need to continue through to annotation steps, but will likely put a pin in it until Monday as my non-class time tomorrow and Friday morning will be going towards studying for my qsci midterm."

Right away, I notice this looks like my homeworks with header 2’s, which then auto creates a live table of contents on the right hand side:\n\nI think that you could put all your notebook updates on one quarto document, and have one document per month (versus a folder full of individual documents for each post that month). There are several benefits to this that I see:\n\nDate is auto populated (if I’m correct and this renders as expected that is)\nYou don’t have to create a whole new document for each post, which can be particularly cumbersome if you don’t have much to update on\nHaving to only update a document versus create a new document could increase the consistency of posting (knowing myself)\nWhen looking back, it is very easy to reference different dates and see progress across the month without having to change which post you’re viewing (can look at them all on the same page and simply scroll)."
