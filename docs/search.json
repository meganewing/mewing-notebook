There are several benefits to this that I see:\n\nDate is auto populated (if I’m correct and this renders as expected that is)\nYou don’t have to create a whole new document for each post, which can be particularly cumbersome if you don’t have much to update on\nHaving to only update a document versus create a new document could increase the consistency of posting (knowing myself)\nWhen looking back, it is very easy to reference different dates and see progress across the month without having to change which post you’re viewing (can look at them all on the same page and simply scroll)."

As I continue reviewing that this week, I will start crackin’ into the clam data."

Mostly just retrieving the files from Gannet, which took some time. While that loaded I was able to start mapping out the next step in the workflow, which will be checking md5sums to confirm file integrity, then using FastQC and MultiQC to look at the quality of our reads. I hope to run these steps tomorrow so I can start next steps (or start some reading to understand what the next steps even are) come Monday. Based on my work with Coho RNAseq data back in 2021, the next steps after fast/multiQC would be:\n\ntrimming\nkallisto to quantify gene expression using the provided reference genome included in github issue.\nuse DESeq2 to visualize DEGs\nrun blast to identify DEG functions\njoin the DEG stats from DESeq2 and the identified DEGs\n\nThe last two I’m a little unsure if those are the right steps for this specific data. The coho analysis was comparing two treatments, and I’m just not entirely sure if that’s the type of analysis we are looking for here. But that is where the reading / literature hunt will come in on Monday.\nWhile the files were loading, I read Race After Technology - Chapter 1 to prep for tomorrow’s lab meeting."

As is, I’m spending 20-25 hours a week on “grad school stuff”, which is about what my target is. But there definitely seemed to be a tradeoff between class and lab stuff, where if I felt like I was making good progress on one, the other was kind of lagging. I’m hoping with having less class time next quarter will help, because the days/weeks in November that I made the most progress on the RNA seq analysis were days that I didn’t have my workflow disrupted by class or didn’t have any homework/class stuff to focus on. If not though, my friend told me about his work taking projects on in “sprints” where they do 1-2 weeks on one project, then 1-2 on a different project, and go back and forth like that. I also remember Aspen mentioning that she focuses the first half of her week on TA duties, with the latter half on Lab/Project stuff. So one goal I have for December (and January once classes start again) is to implement on of these strategies of time management, so I don’t feel like I’m trying to juggle too many things at once, and can spend dedicated time on one thing at a time."

    "text": "Write up for this github issue\nGithub repo available here but each step’s chunk is also linked in workflow write up.\n\nThe Data\nThe RNA-seq data that was analyzed for this issue was from manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) samples of a control and treatment group. There were 15 control samples and 15 treatment samples, each with 2 reads. Each fasta file had the naming scheme M-?-###_R#_001 where ? = C (control) or T(treatment), ### = sample number, and R# = R1 (read 1) or R2 (read 2). Raw files can be found here.\n\n\nThe Workflow\n\nRetrieving Files From Gannet\nTo start the analysis, I retrieved the raw reads from gannet using wget.\nCode on Github\n\n\nChecking File Integrity via MD5sums\nTypically, the next step would be to check the file integrity by comparing the md5sums of the downloaded files with those on the remote server (gannet). However, the directory containing our reads did not have a text file of the md5sums for me to run md5sum on. So we skipped this step.\nCode on Github\n\n\nFastQC and MultiQC\nThe next step was to evaluate the quality of our sequences using FastQC and MultiQC. I generated a FastQC file for each of the reads, and then combined all of those using MultiQC to look at the quality of all of our reads together. The MultiQC report can be found here (note to view the “pretty version” you will need to download the html file and open the local file since github just shows the raw). Here’s some of the results from that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Used:\n\nFastQC (v0.12.1)\n\nCode on Github\n\n\nPsuedo Alignment with Kallisto\nNext I pseudo aligned the reads and quantified expression using Kallisto. I did not trim prior to this as it is not wholly necessary for pseudo alignment. An index for alignment and quantification was created using a reference transcriptome for Ruditapes philippinarum (note: ensure to select for RNA file). Paired end reads for each sample were then aligned and quantified against this index.\nFollowing pseudo alignment and quantification, a trinity matrix was created with the Kallisto output to build an abundance matrix.\nSoftware Used:\n\nKallisto (Linux)(v0.50.1)\nTrinityRNAseq (v2.12.0)\n\nCode on Github\n\n\nDifferential Expression and Visualization with DESeq2\nUsing the quantification in the trinity matrix created, I ran DESeq2 to show deferentially expressed genes, and filtering for those who’s expression showed a difference with a p value &lt;= 0.05. Differential expression was also visualized via a volcano plot and heatmap of the top 25 deferentially expressed genes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with the visualzations, I created a dataframe with the differentially expressed genes and associated statistics (base mean, log 2fold change, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj) and saved as a tab file for the next steps.\nSoftware used:\n\nBiocManager (v1.30.22)\nDESeq2 (v1.38.3)\npheatmap (v1.0.12)\n\nCode on GitHub\n\n\nIdentifying DEG Functions with Blastx\nOnce we had a tab file with differentially expressed genes, we could run blast on our reference genome (note: be sure to select for RNA file). Doing this creates a list of all of the genes (and gene short names) in our reference genome for us to get the names of our DEGs in the next step.\nSoftware used:\n\nNCBI Blast (v2.11.0)\n\nCode on Github\n\n\nJoining DEG with Blast Results and UniProt Gene Ontology Annotations\nUsing the file created from the reference genome Blast, I combined the Blast results with the DEG file by the common gene names. This dataframe contained the gene ID, gene short name, base mean, log 2fold change, pvalue, and padj. I isolated the UniProt IDs from the gene short names in order to retrieve the gene ontology (GO) annotations of interest.\nI looked up the annotations on UniProt’s web interface and saved the output as a tab file. Finally, I merged the Blast/DEG data frame with the GO data frame by the common UniProt ID’s/Entries to get a file of our GO annotations for the significantly deferentially expressed genes. The annotation file is available here.\nCode on Github\n\n\nGeneral (non-step specific) software and hardware info:\nComputer: 2016 MacBook Pro 8GB 13” with macOS Big Sur (v11.2)\nIDE: R Studio (v4.2.3)(via raven)"

So one big goal is to get that wrapped up. Moving forward with that, I want to start planning/getting an idea of what kind of field work or wet work will be needed (if any) for this spring/summer. Finally, I want to get started writing my first chapter (literally anything on a page by the end of March would be sick. Even just my name). If I can hit these goals…time will tell….\nOh also I turn 25 this month so a personal goal is to not get weighed down under the ever looming presence of my own mortality :D\nTLDR; Goals are\n\nWrap up proposal\nPlan for potential wet work\nLiterally any sort of start on Ch. 1\n\nCheers!"

Also open house is next weekend so did some prep with Andy for that.\n\n\nMay 12-18\nClass and regularly scheduled programming. Prep for open house, with grace. Went out on a boat (admiral jack!) with Rosalind and Maritime HS. And had the open house which was sick and had over 1200 estimated visitors!\n\n\nMay 19-26\nClass and lab, re installed x tools to finally get my notebook updated. Started previewing some literature to understand enriched biological processes for clam samples. Was out Thursday afternoon through Monday.\n\n\nMay 27th\nWas out of office still, but in the evening continued working on looking at enriched biological processes functions / role in various pathways.\n\n\nMay 28th\nPresentation for 541. Working on going back to the list of DEG and log2fold change to try and tie back the biological processes to try and parse which ones are increasing or decreasing with my samples. Lottttt of debugging and contemplating becoming an off-the-grid nomad so I never have to touch a computer again.\n\n\nMay 29th\nBright and early I went to continue debugging, with little success. Moved on and wrote up the methods for the clam OA stuff from class/lab, refined my figures a bit, and made my presentation for the creative project for class.\n\n\nMay 30\nWrote up speaker notes for my presenation, did some more background literature reading, and prepped a bit for the presentation. Had class (didn’t present) and lab meeting. Found out during lab meeting that the issues I was having with figuring out how to connect DEG, log2fold change, and BP together was really close to the right solution. Steven says that DAVID provides a uniprot accession number associated with each GO term it gives you, and can use that to connect REVIGO output to DEG expression levels."

When not resting I was able to do a little bit more work on the 3rd one, looking at committee requirements, potential folks to invite, and how to submit the milestone\n\n\nJune 5th\nEmailed committee members, heard back from 2/3. Luke and Jose on board, just waiting to hear back from Mac and then I’ll send out the docusign form and submit the safs milestone.\nAlso worked on finalizing my manila clam repo, getting the readme docs updated. Forwarded the hisat workflow write up and repo to mac as well.\nTroubleshooted VPN problems to no avail. And still sick so wasn’t able to go into the office…\n\n\nJune 6th\nHeard back from mac and we’re good to go. Finalized manila clam repo and finished updating the readme docs. Submitted final lab assignment.\n\n\nJune 10th\nWent over lurida workflow to date ( just blast) to check outputs and added some visualizations. Started to search for various known (to literature) genes associated with repro (ex. dmrt) to see if present in blast output. Coordinated with mac to setup a time to go over committee and clam stuff."

    "text": "July 8th\nFinally got in with IT to talk about VPN issues that have preventing WFH. Looks like a security update happened for the VPN that makes it no longer compatible with my computer as my 2016 macbook can’t update to the neccessary MacOS 13 Ventura. I suppose that WFH will now have to be reserved for another day (and another paycheck…)\n\n\nJuly 9th\nWent into the office and worked on some rphil updates. Reduced results to gene level by e value, and worked to filter DESeq results. Updated figures and enrichment.\n\n\nJuly 10th\nMet with mac to go over rphil updates. Next steps are to continue to mess around with different filter settings to see what genes persist, and keep updating visualizations.\n\n\nJuly 17th\nWorked on DESeq and Heatmap code to 1) clean it up to make it a bit more clear and 2) refine the heatmaps for each of the analysis so far. Started first readthrough of the rphil manuscript too.\n\n\nJuly 19th\nLight week, but got some technical issues figured out and moved enough of the clam repo local to do some of the less heavy analysis from home again. Finished manuscript read through. Prepped for Chris’ panel next week.\n\n\nJuly 24th\nWent back and reconciled for the missing 193 sample. Redid featurcounts to include 193.\n\n\nJuly 25th\nContunued reconcilation for 193 and went and redid the analysis downstream of hisat / featurecounts. The number of DEGs now more closely matches Giles’ results. First round of prefiltering of deseq results too.\n\n\nJuly 26th\nChris’ student panel thing. More work on deseq prefiltering\n\n\nJuly 27th\nMore deseq prefiltering and moved onto by group specific prefiltering. Identified consistent top genes across each pre filtering parameter and set up list for annoation.\n\n\nJuly 30th\nPost filtering analysis, creating heatmaps, and running recurring DEGs through annotation.\n\n^ basically a short visual summary of the filtering process\npre-filtered featurecounts matrix / deseq to only include results that hit certain parameters:\n\naverage of 10+ reads across 3+ samples (10r3n) (DEG = 84)\naverage of 10+ reads across 15+ samples (10r15n) (DEG = 45)\naverage of 10+ reads across 30 samples (10r30n) (DEG = 38)\naverage of 10+ reads across each treatment (10r ToC) (DEG = 87)\n\n\n\n\nAfter making heatmaps, I used the list of recurring genes I made and ran that though the first annotation step. (Not going all the way through uniprot just yet )\n\nThen made a heatmap of these recurring genes\n\n\n\nJuly 31st\nMet with mac to review results and discuss new parameter options for pre filtering. Then learned how to read gonad histology slides with Mac and Eala"

    "text": "August 7th\nAugust goals, submitted masters committee milestone. Based off of what Mac and i discussed last week, I went back to trying different pre-filtering parameters and decided to take a different approach. Created histogram, boxplot, and generated summary stats for all of the count data to see how they were spread. We knew the rRNA was eating up a ton of the reads, so I wanted to visually see the spread a bit better, where I could ignore the rRNA interference and make a decision on what made sense as a cutoff for pre-filtering. Depending on if I set the cutoff for the histogram and boxplot counts ranging between 0-50, 0-100, 0-1000, 0-6000, or all counts, the median stayed between 20 to 30. When using all counts the median was 23.\n\nI set the pre-filter parameters to at least 23 counts for at least 8 individuals (so, at least half) for control OR treatment group.\n\nThe control and treatment groups stayed together on the heatmap, even when clustered, which is promising.\n\nWaiting on egg quality / mother quality data to make some sense of the samples that still seem to not show super distinct differences in expression.\n\n\nAugust 13th\nSmall day. Got the egg quality data and started to review it. Bit more info than anticipated. Also organized different degrees of “outliers” (not really outliers) of the samples that didn’t have super distinct expression, based off of the clustering in the heatmap from last week to give an idea what samples to keep an eye out for when diving into the egg data.\n\n\nAugust 14th\nIdentifying patterns in egg quality data as it relates to the samples in the heatmap. But found that there wasn’t enough egg quality info about the samples that are the “outliers” since not all mothers had egg quality data measured. Results inconclusive.\n\n\n\nAugust 15th\nSwitched to looking for patterns in read QC. ie, looking if total number of aligned reads explained any of the data in our heatmap (thinking, “maybe those with overall less reads are the ones that have less distinct expression compared to others in their treatment group”). no dice.\n\nColors represent the clustering of samples, where more blue shows “cooler” expression on the heatmap for the chunk of genes that are generally “hotter” in the control group. More red bars = “hotter” on the heatmap.\n\n\nAugust 17th\nAfter talking to mac, going to proceed towards annotation with the latest gene list (from aug 7). Clustering looks good, pre filter parameters have sound biological reasoning, and nothing seems to be explaining the differences in expression (or lack of differences) that relates to egg or read quality.\nHad an issue previously with blast not having hits for all of my genes in my DEG list, which is odd since the genome is fully annotated. Mac suggested try running with less stringent e value. Went from E-20 to E-5 which feels drastic, but I do filter out for just the hit with the best e value for each LOC, and can use bit score to confirm integrity of the results later downstream.\n\n\nAugust 21st\nGot the blast results and took a peak, still not getting all the matches (left hand columns are DEG stats, right hand columns are from the blast output):\nblast code:\n\noutput (after joining):\n\nNot really sure what is going on and if this is expected or not.\nBusy week with other jobs, didn’t really have time to do anything besides glance at this and give it one go.\n\n\nAugust 26th\nPer Mac’s advice, I went onto NCBI where I could manually search for each of the LOC (aka, “symbol”s) within the list of annotated genes for r.phil, and all the ones that had NAs after joining had matches, so I still can’t figure out why there are NAs when going the blast route. Steven says its “to be expected” with species like this, but I still don’t really understand why.\n(relevant github issue)\n(relevant code file ; blast code linked above, if needed)\nI revised the code to join the DEG data to a tsv of the annotated genes from NCBI, which paired data to all of my LOC (no NA’s), but there’s no SPID (uniprot accession numbers) associated with the data.\nI want to be able to move onto gene ontology, but not sure how to do so without uniprot accession numbers.\nTo resolve this I tried two approaches:\nFIRST:\nWhile no SPID, there was however, protein accession numbers. Since this genome annotation was RefSeq, I changed the ‘from database’ and used the protein accession numbers. To no avail. It mapped to UniParc, which provided no GO information\n\n\nSECOND:\nI tried re joining my new DEG/annotation joined list to the full blast results by protein ID/accession number. This still left me with NAs, even for characterized proteins.\n\nSo I’m not sure where to go from here.\nI want to be able to get GO information so I can get biological process information.\n\n\nAugust 28th\n\nProvide preview (head) of BLAST output table.\n\n\n\nProvide preview of your query file(s) for BLASTing.\n\nI don’t have this right now because it’s too big to push and my computer doesn’t work with the VPN. Will update when I can go to the office tomorrow. It is on raven though and the relative path is ../data/ncbi_dataset/data/GCF_026571515.1/cds_from_genomic.fna\n\nProvide preview (head) of 0807-DEGstats_ToC_8ind23r.tab.\n\n\n\nProvide preview (head) of ncbi_dataset.tsv.\n\n\ncol 1-9\n\ncol 9-15\nIncluding step-wise previews of the various tables/files will greatly help.\nhttps://rpubs.com/mewing0/1214571\nAlso, a clear statement on what data you’re starting with and what you want for an end result will help.\nthe workflow, generally speaking, is as follows (starting from featurecounts)\n\nfeaturecounts -&gt;\nfilter out any genes that don’t meet the parameters (see aug. 7) -&gt;\nDESeq2 -&gt; filter for significant padj -&gt;\ngenerated a dataframe that has the DEGs and corresponding stats (see above) & a dataframe that has DEGs and corresponding counts for each sample (not super relevant) -&gt;\nWANT: to connect annotation information to DEG list that will allow me to get GO terms (whether through uniprot accession numbers/SPID or other methods unknown to me)\n\n\n\nAugust 29th\nThe plan today was to update the rpub I had created and keep working on this issue. The plan got derailed for the WILDest reason.\nAt approximately 9:30 am, I was driving with my roomate to seattle from Renton. As we pull up to a stoplight underneath a 405 overpass, we see a KITTEN FALL from the 25’+ overpass!!!\nWe managed to pick her up as she tried to crawl under the car and into the engine bay, singeing her fur and whiskers in the attempt. We took her to the vet, and after hours of waiting, she is miraculously okay! Only some lacerations on her bum and one on her lip. They estimated her to be 6-7 weeks, and weighed in at 2.20 lbs 🥹\nWe then took her home and set up a room for her (because of course we are keeping her). By the time we got back from the vet, it was 3:30 pm, and I had to go to work, so rpub will have to wait until friday.\nAnyways, meet OP! (short for overpass)\n\n\n\nAugust 30th\nMore troubleshoot with the github issue and editing my rpub comments to be more clear. No resolution in regards to my blast issue, but was directed to just move forward to using literature to understand the physiology."

    "text": "September 3rd\nWorked on some personal administration stuff, registering for fall, going through emails, scheduling committee meeting, etc.\nMeet with Mac tomorrow to go over latest r.phil results so did some work to prep for that: I went ahead and moved forward on joining the SPIDs for the DEG entries that had them (retrieved SPIDs from blast). Of the remaining ~12 DEGs, only 5 of which were characterized. For these 5, I used the annotated gene table on NCBI web interface to get the gene name which I manually entered into UniProt to get similar genes with GO, tissue, development, and induction information. Where possible, I also filtered the taxonomy for the UniProt results to include only bivalves or, where no bivalve genes showed as matches, mollusks. Genes that did not have hits for bivalves or mollusks had less than 35 total matches when no taxonomy filter was applied. The links to the results were then added to a ‘notes’ column in the master dataframe for reference come literature review.\n\n\nSeptember 4th\nLast we discussed, Mac and I also talked about the large number of reads that are being “sucked up” by ribosomal hits, so I went back to my full counts matrix to pull the stats and counts for all genes our samples mapped to to get a list of the ribosomal RNA.\nMet with Mac to go over updated results and next steps. She gave me some really helpful insights on what could be going wrong with my blast and what steps I need to re-work through to troubleshoot:\n\nSomething going on in the join causing me to lose some hits/LOCs, OR \nThe fasta is wrong somehow and to check the number of sequences in the fasta, OR\nMy blast commands need to be checked / changed – If it doesn’t hit my e value, is it excluded or left with NAs ? Want to make sure nothing is getting dropped\n\nI’m out of town for the next few days so this will have to wait til I can get back into the office so I can have access to Raven, but the results I have currently are enough to move forward.\n\n\nSeptember 6th\nVery minor updates to google drive with my draft of methods/results, and the master dataframe. After my discussion with mac wanted to double check that the entries i did have SPIDs for, that the SPIDs even made sense, so I checked the UniProt hit against the annotated genome hit and they checked out, so that is good.\nSeptember goals and notebook update."

    "text": "Whoops haven’t updated daily posts in awhile… here’s what you missed in the last 3 weeks:\n\nsubmitted aquaculture 2025 abstract\nhad first committee meeting\nmet with individuals from NOAA, WDFW, King County, UW (both admin and profs), WSP and FHL to discuss career paths and opportunities to look out for\nGRFP workshop mentoring!\ngot obscenely sick for a few days\n\nOkay, here’s where we are now:\n\nOctober 9th\nAdded some of my DEG findings and methods to a comparison chart with Giles’ outputs to see if our results are consistent. Once we can confirm everything looks good, I can full deep dive with the interpretation of the results.\nLast session of the GRFP workshop with the NSF style review. Really cool to see how diverse the applications are!\n\n\nOctober 11th\nMet with mac to review the results. Seems like there are differences in Giles’ findings with STAR alignment rates and my HiSAT alignment rates. He trimmed before aligning (I did not), so next step is to go back and trim and re align one sample with hisat to see if it improves alignment rate. If it doesn’t, then we’ll use the feature counts matrix that was generated from STAR alignmened samples to run downstream analysis from there. If it does, then I’ll trim all the samples, re-align them with hisat, and then do the downstream analyis.\nThis will have to wait until next week though because the Col. of Env. travel fund application is due today, and not the 18th as I originally thought.\n\n\nOctober 16th\nRe writing the analysis as mentioned on Friday. Haven’t run it yet as I’ll need to go onto campus to get access to raven and my raw data files again without just re downloading it all.\nStarting to think about chapter 1 methods. Found the paper Luke talked about in my committee meeting: “The genetic basis of novel trait gain in walking fish”\n\n\nOctober 17th\nRead the sea robin paper about fish walking genes – super cool!!! The walking sea robins had 3 pectoral fin rays that are highly modified for walking and seperated from the rest of the fin once the sea robin is fully developed. They were able to identify the genes involved through RNA-seq before, during, and after development of these modifications (before/during after the ‘seperation’ of the modified rays). They then used crispr to turn off the gene they identified and then raised hybrid sea robins that had between 2 and 4 modified rays once fully developed! Super cool insights into not only the underlying genes, but how the phenotype is inherited!\nTGIT\nWas on campus and was able to execute the trim and hisat code. Trimming improved alignment for my selected sample from ~63% to ~67% mapping rate, but still substantially lower than Giles’ mapping rate (~ 75%). Next step to re-run\n\n\nOctober 18th\nStarted re-running deseq2 using Giles’ STAR count data. Got done with the heatmaps and realized I had a sample mislabled which made the treatment vs. control for everything funky. need to edit and re run. Womp womp. Have work so, problem for another day.\n\n\nOctober 20th\nFinished re running deseq2. Used original hisat parameters of excluding any genes that dont have: at least 8 individuals in treatment OR 8 individuals in control with at least 23 reads (hisat median non-zero read count for all genes).\nRe ran again with updated parameters of 27 reads (updated/star median non-zero read count for all genes).\nUpdated comparison stats chart AND comparison DEG chart. results from comparison DEG chart:"

    "text": "Who’s Lit is it Anyways?\n\nThis month has been a lot of paper hunting. Here’s a list of some of the papers from the last two weeks I’ve been digging through. A big thing I’ve been looking for is to get a general understanding of what might be typical differences in egg gene expression. Whether its as a results of parental priming to OA, spawn timing, immune system stimulation, etc. How much of an impact is parental contributions really having on egg expression?\nA lot of the lit out there seems to be looking at priming within a generation, which seems to yield somewhat substantial differences between control and treatment groups (lots of DEGs). But when looking at eggs from treated vs control parents, there is less of a difference (few DEGs).\nMy shift now (5/15) is to find literature to continue fleshing out these different responses as a result of different life stages, different tissue types being analyzed, different types of stressors, etc. And also to dive deeper into the functional interpretation of the genes to see what kind of impact our DEGs have been having in other bivalves, and if they have been observed as DEGs in similar studies to ours.\n\n\n\nauthor\nyear\ntitle\nlink\n\n\nPauletto\n2017\nTranscriptomic features of Pecten maximus oocyte quality and maturation\nhttps://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0172805\n\n\nCheung\n2019\nWhat makes a bad egg?

    "text": "Is it better to have green energy or increased salmon habitat? Issues facing dam re-licensing processes in the Upper Skagit watershed:\nSaturday, May 17th, the 447 (watershed ecology) group went to Ross Dam, Diablo Dam overlook, Gorge Dam, Newhalem, Baker Lake Dam, Oso, Skagit River, Swinomish River, and Sauk River.\nWe were discussing the different functions of each dam, which are all run by Seattle City Light. Ross dam, the upper-most dam on the Skagit, is primarily for flood control and water retention with the ability to store 9 days to 9 weeks worth of water in the reservoir above the dam. Diablo Dam, the middle dam on the Upper Skagit, is primarily for hydropower. The lowest of the Skagit dam is Gorge Dam and is, interestingly, a “fish-first” dam. The primary function of Gorge dam is to moderate water levels in a way that will benefit fish. While the power generated from water releases does not go unused, the changes in flow rates are strictly determined by fish through the following:\n\nconstant monitoring of how much water in river (so as to never de-water or dry out redds)\nthey lower the river when salmon/steelhead come in to spawn, to ensure redds get built more in the center of river, rather than edges. This guarantees the redds will have water coverage and stay in channel even with fluctuating water levels\nstream and redd monitoring to ensure that even the highest ‘elevation’ redd stays wet and adjust dam operations to do so, never letting the water level drop below the level needed by that redd\nthey ensure the power balancing flows don’t interfere with fish activity and keep the ramping rate slowed down to not freak out or strand fish (ie., no large flood-pulses from dam releases)\n\nSo, power, water resource management, and fish-friendly operations? It may seem that the Upper Skagit dams may have it pretty figured out. Yet no anadromous fish make it upstream of the Gorges dam: one of many reasons these dams create tension between Seattle City Light and the residents (current and traditional) of the Upper Skagit watershed…\n\nGorge Dam (“fish first”)\nWhy are the talk about these dams now? Why is it such a hot topic of debate? These three dams, with their distinct function, work together as a system. When operations of one change, the others can be affected in turn.\nThe Ross Lake dam had it FERC license expire in January of this year. FERC licenses give approval from the federal government for dams to operate, detail how that particular dam must be operated for the duration of the license period, and are valid for 30-50 years. This means that when a license expires, the renewal process provides a relatively short window of time for all licensing partners to determine how the dam will operate for potentially the next half century. Seattle City Light is currently about 5-10 years into the arduous process of renewing the Ross Lake dam licence. As such, there has been a lot of discussion about what the future of this dam will be, specifically with regards to fish. Recall that these dams are operated by Seattle City Light, with the power generated being going only to Seattle residents, meaning the environments and watersheds that are being impacted by the dam presence the most are not receiving the benefits the dams provide. This has led to a lot of pressure for dam removals from locals, particularly tribes, amidst the renewal process. Traditional knowledge asserts that there were historic salmon runs above this dam, while western scientists point to lack of isotope or molecular evidence to support this. This has led to a contentious re-licencing process as SCL works to find a solution that will satisfy all licensing partners.\nOne approach to satisfying all licensing partner goals (namely the goals of keeping the dams and helping the salmon) that they are looking towards is improving fish passage. With Ross Lake dam towering at 590 ft tall (30 feet shorter than its initially intended height), traditional fish passage methods present a challenge should licensing partners agree to return salmon to above the highest of the 3 dams on the upper skagit river.\nNearby Baker Lake uses a “trap and truck” approach which traps sockeye below the dam using a salmon lock (“elevator”) system that allows them to be loaded into trucks without human handling. They then get trucked and released above the 312 ft tall dam along a reach of river with “redd beaches”– ie., reaches with ample spawning habitat. The loading, trucking, and releasing process takes about 30 minutes.\nIt now becomes important to note that Ross Lake Dam is not accessible via road. You can only get to the dam by hiking the 1.5 mi trail off of HWY 20, or by driving to Diablo Dam and boarding a barge. The barge can boat you from Diablo Dam to the base of Ross Lake Dam, and from there you can take a steep gravel access road to the top of the dam and upper reservoir. A stark difference from the infrastructure present below and above Baker Lake’s dam.\n\nRoss Lake Dam. 590 ft tall.\nThe city and the tribes had reached a head, with two options on the table: be in the renewal process indefinitely, or agree to put fish above Ross Lake dam. Seattle City Light has agreed to the latter.\nThis is not the end of the issue associated with the Upper Skagit dams and their relicensing processes, and trucking the fish above the dams will not be the end of the salmon issue in the Skagit River. There are still several areas of public criticism. Some reaches between dams, particularly above the Gorges dam, that were once moderately flowing streams, are now de-watered most of the year, changing the core geomorphologic and hydrological regimes that were once present and in turn, the habitat availability for organisms within the reach. Simply put, Salmon, if reintroduced to these reaches, would not be able to survive in a meaningful way.\nFurther, at the complete other end of the Skagit, on Fir Island near Mt. Vernon, what was once an estuary and rich habitat for outgoing smolt, has been converted to farmland. Fingers are being pointed back and forth between Seattle City Light, who attempted to purchase farmlands on Fir Island to restore estuarian habitat, and the farmers, who passed a law saying farm land can’t be purchased with the purpose of executing a restoration project. Seattle City Lights look towards habitat restoration to take pressure off of them for the impacts of the dams, and farmers look towards dam removal to take pressure off of them for the impacts of agriculture on former smolt nursery habitat.\nAll this is to say, the dam functions and the move towards improving fish passage (or attempting to) are two of many issues facing the Skagit River. The FERC relicensing process has opened the conversation for what the future of this river will be, the state of the salmon populations, and the ethics of these dams existing so far from the watershed that is benefiting from their presence.\n\nDe-watered reach downstream of Gorge Dam"

    "text": "July Goals\n\nFinish clam chapter intro + discussion, send to committee\nGet gene lists for all bivalve species\nGet consensus tree (or get UCEs mapped for at least 2 species)\n\n\n\nJuly Daily Updates\nNote, once Spring quarter and finals finished, I was moving so didn’t get much done aside from a little bit of outlining for clam chapter.\n\nJuly 1-9th\nLumping this swath of days together as it was pretty much one continuous effort of putting together the clam chapter. I pulled the methods and results from the shared MS and added in the extra contextualizing details as needed (eg., experimental setup info). I also pulled the last discussion draft I had worked on with Mac and Emma before Emma did the final push and revision for the MS draft. There was still a little bit of work to be done on that, including concluding statements, tying back in some more sources to support my interpretations and compare the results to similar studies, and tying in the DEGs to carryover effects (ie., can these results really indicate the parent conditions primed the offspring). The intro I wrote from scratch. Much of this time was me sifting through literature (incl. many maternal RNA papers), outlining, and staring at my screen trying to figure out what I wanted to say. Eventually got a draft and then spent a day or two refining it before sending it out to the committee on the 10th.\nThere was also a day in here where I stepped away from the writing and worked some more on the workflow for the other chapter. Started w the C. gigas genome. Ran blast using tblastn with the genome as the database and the genes under the GO term as the query. Set e value to 1e-10 which returned around ~3000, with some sequence IDs in the genome having multiple hits for different species versions of the same gene (eg., MOUSE_TEST1, HUMAN_TEST1). Code here.\n\n\nJuly 10th\nFinal lookover of clam chapter, double checking all sources were sited (and hunting down some of them that seemed to elude my paperpile folders — which was mostly just the methods/code package related sources). Sent to committee (first july goal done!). Shifting gears to bivalve chapter.\n(was out of town july 11th-14th)\n\n\nJuly 15th\nContinued with the gmt chapter workflow. Got the GO:bp info from uniprot and finished the annotation. Since there was multiple hits I also filtered by out the top hit by highest bitscore (so if MOUSE_TEST1 had bitscore of 98, and HUMAN_TEST1 had a bitscore of 87, the mouse version of the gene was the one was kept). A potential issue with this may be that there could be different genes mapped to the same sequence like TEST1 vs. some other gene that both had lets say 30% match to. One solution to this might be to redo my filtering for top hits based on % identity, so the protein version that has a higher % match is the one that is kept, but I’m also not sure if I want to filter down further to say ‘anything less than 30% match gets excluded’ for example. Currently, the lowest % post filter is ~17%\nLuke is at a conference currently but I’ve emailed him to set a time to meet and discuss some of this. My goal is to get this example workflow finalized with an output that sets me up nicely for the Robinson-foulds mapping. I want my gene list to be filtered but need guidance on which way might be the most justified. Code here. Outputs here (note that the gene list is filtered for top bitscore hit but does not include pident, while the annotation file does include pident but is not filtered for top bitscore hit).\n\n\nLooking forward\nBy early next week I’d like to get the code running for the other 16 bivalve species and have all of my gene lists by the end of next week. Concurrently, I may start working on creating my consensus tree workflow, but since I’m very unfamiliar with this methodology, I’m not sure what the timeline or procedure is for that. So between coding things, it’ll be a little bit of looking through forums and literature about building trees using UCEs and I’ll look into the bitscore vs. pident filter debate a bit as well in the more immediate meantime (aka this week).\n\n\nJuly 21st\nFinished gene list generation for all bivalve species:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAssembly Accession\nOrganism Name\nCommon Name\nGbp\n# Seq in DB (genome)\n# Seq in Querey\n# of Query Matches\n\n\nGCF_002022765.2\nCrassostrea virginica\nEastern Oyster\n0.118\n60213\n4234\n3129\n\n\nGCF_026914265.1\nMya arenaria\nSoft Shell Clam\n0.126\n61919\n4234\n3116\n\n\nGCF_963853765.1\nMagallana gigas\nPacific Oyster\n0.110\n51045\n4234\n3127\n\n\nGCF_041381155.1\nArgopecten irradians\nBay Scallop\n0.085\n41903\n4234\n3129\n\n\nGCF_963676685.1\nMytilus edulis\nBlue Mussel\n0.134\n62345\n4234\n3128\n\n\nGCF_902652985.1\nPecten maximus\nGreat Scallop\n0.072\n39918\n4234\n3116\n\n\nGCF_025612915.1\nMagallana angulata\nPortugese Oyster\n0.102\n49950\n4234\n3135\n\n\nGCF_947568905.1\nOstrea edulis\nEuropean Flat Oyster\n0.117\n57349\n4234\n3140\n\n\nGCF_021730395.1\nMercenaria mercenaria\nHard Clam\n0.121\n63247\n4234\n3058\n\n\nGCF_020536995.1\nDreissena polymorpha\nZebra Mussel\n0.140\n75288\n4234\n3105\n\n\nGCF_036588685.1\nMytilus trossulus\nPacific Blue Mussel\n0.099\n53269\n4234\n3128\n\n\nGCF_026571515.1\nRuditapes philippinarum\nManila Clam\n0.097\n57637\n4234\n3098\n\n\nGCF_002113885.1\nMizuhopecten yessoensis\nYesso Scallop\n0.082\n41567\n4234\n3122\n\n\nGCF_021869535.1\nMytilus californianus\nCalifornia Mussel\n0.104\n49739\n4234\n3083\n\n\nGCF_033153115.1\nSaccostrea echinata\nBlacklip Rock Oyster\n0.065\n36217\n4234\n3143\n\n\nGCF_032062105.1\nSaccostrea cuccullata\nNatal Rock Oyster\n0.091\n56432\n4234\n3120\n\n\nGCF_031769215.1\nYlistrum balloti\nBallot Saucer Scallop\n0.042\n24047\n4234\n3106\n\n\n\n\n\nJuly 24th\nStarted on phyluce tutorial III to retrieve UCEs from each of the bivalve genomes & installing packages (and troubleshooting associated with that)\n\n\nJuly 28th\ncontinued phyluce tutorial.

    "text": "Dailies\n\nAug 1\nPreviewed some of my outputs to see if they looked as expected. The 2 bait files I was using each had 10,000 sequences that are ultraconserved throughout mollusca (bait v1) and bivalvia (bait v2), yet some of the species had very few hits, some (zebra mussel) with 0 total hits. Not sure why this is happening so spent some time reading previous issues on the phyluce github page and troubleshooting to see why some uce’s weren’t found in some genomes. Another issue was that the samples were losing sequences when converting from lastz to fasta (see below). spent some time troubleshooting that as well. Luke and I are going to meet to talk about it but we’re both out of the office for the next ~two weeks so it’ll have to wait.\n\n\n\nAug 19\nBack in town! Met with Luke this morning to review outputs and troubleshoot together. It seems that the reduction from lastz to fasta sequences is expected as the conversion only keeps the UCE sequence (DB) that the genome sequence (query) had the strongest match to.\nThe issue regarding some of the samples not having any hits seems to be with the significance or identiy match specification default for phyluce. There was an ommitted argument in the phyluce alignment (was omitted in the tutorial I was following) but I was able to find it in a different phyluce and re ran the alignment with --identity 50 and --identity 80 with much more success. The average for 50 identity was ~860 (v1) and ~740 (v2), and for 80 identity was ~500 (v1) and ~550 (v2). (v1 is bait for mollusca more generally, and v2 is the bait for bivalvia more specifically). This is on par with the ~850 average UCE matches found by Li et al., 2024 (who provided the bait sequences used).\nOh and here’s the repo. Phyluce stuff is in data/phyluce/\n\n\nAug 21\nnow that I had my UCEs successfully harvested, I had to switch to a different phyluce tutorial. Eventually I want to have folders with fastas of UCEs that map to 50%, 75%, and 95% of the taxa, and matrixes in proper format representing these so that they can be input into IQ tree for the species consensus tree I want to build. The species consensus tree will then be what I use to run robinson foulds distance for the (repro) gene trees to identify reproductive genes of interest.\nthe general workflow for all this is then:\n\nharvest UCEs (identifying which UCEs are present in each of the 17 bivalves) (Tutorial III) –&gt;\ncreate two data matrixes – one with complete representation (UCEs in all samples) and one with incomplete (UCEs in at least 3 samples). treat the UCE outputs from tutorial III as contigs (daily use phyluce tutorial) –&gt;\nuse these matrixes to then extract, align, and trim UCEs of interest and generate fasta files for them (tutorial I, starting with the aligning UCE loci)\n\nso today I took the outputs from tutorial III and started working on the data matrices to proccess UCEs.\n\n\nAug 22\nfinished with the daily use tutorial and got UCE fastas for all the UCEs found within my bivavles. next step is to continue onto tutorial I and align and trim them to prep for IQ tree.\n\n\nAug 25\nraven down…womp womp\nstarted reviewing some of the comments on my proposal draft from like 9 months ago lol. realized a common theme was that i needed more sources and a bit more explanation regarding 1) how gametogenesis in bivalves works, and 2) why it matters. So started some lit review for that. mostly reading chapters 1, 2, 4, and 6 in “Reproduction in Aquatic Animals”: (Yoshida M, Asturiano JF (eds) (2020) Reproduction in aquatic animals, 2020th ed. Springer, Singapore, Singapore.) which covered spermatogenesis, oogenesis, fertilization, etc.\n\n\nAug 26\nRaven was still down in the morning so I continued with some of my lit review in the morning looking at parental effects on offspring (specifically looking for paternal impacts since the manila clam stuff gave a decent dive into maternal influence).\nThen started work on tutorial I\n\n\nAug 27\ncontinued and concluded work on tutorial I. aligned and trimmed the uce loci using mafft alignment and internal trimming (due to potential evolutionary distance of some of the bivalve species) and cleaned alignments. then was able to generate data folders of 50%, 75% and 95% representation (folder contained the fasta files of UCEs present for each % of taxa and stated uce and corresponding taxa sequence) and matrices that concatenated these files. Then converted the concatenated files into phyllip format for use in IQ tree."
