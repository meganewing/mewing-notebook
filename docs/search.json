Not super sure how to get that going besides just making posts with executable code but that seems…disorganized.\nBlast Stuff\nBeen working on the blast tutorial. Haven’t started with the geoduck file given in the assigned github issue yet, as I wanted to make sure I could get through the workflow with the example files/links in the tutorials without issue first, before adding in another variable. Plus, I figured it would be a good opportunity to dust off the cobwebs when it comes to creating a robust and reusable script.\nI’ve made it through all the visualization steps fine so far, but have been running into issues once trying to run the actual blast. Since it’s Wednesday evening though and I won’t be working on this much longer tonight, I figured I’ll wait til lab meeting."

Right away, I notice this looks like my homeworks with header 2’s, which then auto creates a live table of contents on the right hand side:\n\nI think that you could put all your notebook updates on one quarto document, and have one document per month (versus a folder full of individual documents for each post that month). There are several benefits to this that I see:\n\nDate is auto populated (if I’m correct and this renders as expected that is)\nYou don’t have to create a whole new document for each post, which can be particularly cumbersome if you don’t have much to update on\nHaving to only update a document versus create a new document could increase the consistency of posting (knowing myself)\nWhen looking back, it is very easy to reference different dates and see progress across the month without having to change which post you’re viewing (can look at them all on the same page and simply scroll)."

    "text": "Nov. 8 - Clam RNAseq work\nPretty chill day – some homework in the morning before class.\nAfter class, I got started on the clam rnaseq analysis. Mostly just retrieving the files from Gannet, which took some time. While that loaded I was able to start mapping out the next step in the workflow, which will be checking md5sums to confirm file integrity, then using FastQC and MultiQC to look at the quality of our reads. I hope to run these steps tomorrow so I can start next steps (or start some reading to understand what the next steps even are) come Monday. Based on my work with Coho RNAseq data back in 2021, the next steps after fast/multiQC would be:\n\ntrimming\nkallisto to quantify gene expression using the provided reference genome included in github issue.\nuse DESeq2 to visualize DEGs\nrun blast to identify DEG functions\njoin the DEG stats from DESeq2 and the identified DEGs\n\nThe last two I’m a little unsure if those are the right steps for this specific data. The coho analysis was comparing two treatments, and I’m just not entirely sure if that’s the type of analysis we are looking for here. But that is where the reading / literature hunt will come in on Monday.\nWhile the files were loading, I read Race After Technology - Chapter 1 to prep for tomorrow’s lab meeting."

As is, I’m spending 20-25 hours a week on “grad school stuff”, which is about what my target is. But there definitely seemed to be a tradeoff between class and lab stuff, where if I felt like I was making good progress on one, the other was kind of lagging. I’m hoping with having less class time next quarter will help, because the days/weeks in November that I made the most progress on the RNA seq analysis were days that I didn’t have my workflow disrupted by class or didn’t have any homework/class stuff to focus on. If not though, my friend told me about his work taking projects on in “sprints” where they do 1-2 weeks on one project, then 1-2 on a different project, and go back and forth like that. I also remember Aspen mentioning that she focuses the first half of her week on TA duties, with the latter half on Lab/Project stuff. So one goal I have for December (and January once classes start again) is to implement on of these strategies of time management, so I don’t feel like I’m trying to juggle too many things at once, and can spend dedicated time on one thing at a time."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Write up for this github issue\nGithub repo available here but each step’s chunk is also linked in workflow write up.\n\nThe Data\nThe RNA-seq data that was analyzed for this issue was from manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) samples of a control and treatment group. There were 15 control samples and 15 treatment samples, each with 2 reads. Each fasta file had the naming scheme M-?-###_R#_001 where ? = C (control) or T(treatment), ### = sample number, and R# = R1 (read 1) or R2 (read 2). Raw files can be found here.\n\n\nThe Workflow\n\nRetrieving Files From Gannet\nTo start the analysis, I retrieved the raw reads from gannet using wget.\nCode on Github\n\n\nChecking File Integrity via MD5sums\nTypically, the next step would be to check the file integrity by comparing the md5sums of the downloaded files with those on the remote server (gannet). However, the directory containing our reads did not have a text file of the md5sums for me to run md5sum on. So we skipped this step.\nCode on Github\n\n\nFastQC and MultiQC\nThe next step was to evaluate the quality of our sequences using FastQC and MultiQC. I generated a FastQC file for each of the reads, and then combined all of those using MultiQC to look at the quality of all of our reads together. The MultiQC report can be found here (note to view the “pretty version” you will need to download the html file and open the local file since github just shows the raw). Here’s some of the results from that:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Used:\n\nFastQC (v0.12.1)\n\nCode on Github\n\n\nPsuedo Alignment with Kallisto\nNext I pseudo aligned the reads and quantified expression using Kallisto. I did not trim prior to this as it is not wholly necessary for pseudo alignment. An index for alignment and quantification was created using a reference transcriptome for Ruditapes philippinarum (note: ensure to select for RNA file). Paired end reads for each sample were then aligned and quantified against this index.\nFollowing pseudo alignment and quantification, a trinity matrix was created with the Kallisto output to build an abundance matrix.\nSoftware Used:\n\nKallisto (Linux)(v0.50.1)\nTrinityRNAseq (v2.12.0)\n\nCode on Github\n\n\nDifferential Expression and Visualization with DESeq2\nUsing the quantification in the trinity matrix created, I ran DESeq2 to show deferentially expressed genes, and filtering for those who’s expression showed a difference with a p value &lt;= 0.05. Differential expression was also visualized via a volcano plot and heatmap of the top 25 deferentially expressed genes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong with the visualzations, I created a dataframe with the differentially expressed genes and associated statistics (base mean, log 2fold change, lfcSE, stat, pvalue, padj) and saved as a tab file for the next steps.\nSoftware used:\n\nBiocManager (v1.30.22)\nDESeq2 (v1.38.3)\npheatmap (v1.0.12)\n\nCode on GitHub\n\n\nIdentifying DEG Functions with Blastx\nOnce we had a tab file with differentially expressed genes, we could run blast on our reference genome (note: be sure to select for RNA file). Doing this creates a list of all of the genes (and gene short names) in our reference genome for us to get the names of our DEGs in the next step.\nSoftware used:\n\nNCBI Blast (v2.11.0)\n\nCode on Github\n\n\nJoining DEG with Blast Results and UniProt Gene Ontology Annotations\nUsing the file created from the reference genome Blast, I combined the Blast results with the DEG file by the common gene names. This dataframe contained the gene ID, gene short name, base mean, log 2fold change, pvalue, and padj. I isolated the UniProt IDs from the gene short names in order to retrieve the gene ontology (GO) annotations of interest.\nI looked up the annotations on UniProt’s web interface and saved the output as a tab file. Finally, I merged the Blast/DEG data frame with the GO data frame by the common UniProt ID’s/Entries to get a file of our GO annotations for the significantly deferentially expressed genes. The annotation file is available here.\nCode on Github\n\n\nGeneral (non-step specific) software and hardware info:\nComputer: 2016 MacBook Pro 8GB 13” with macOS Big Sur (v11.2)\nIDE: R Studio (v4.2.3)(via raven)"

So one big goal is to get that wrapped up. Moving forward with that, I want to start planning/getting an idea of what kind of field work or wet work will be needed (if any) for this spring/summer. Finally, I want to get started writing my first chapter (literally anything on a page by the end of March would be sick. Even just my name). If I can hit these goals…time will tell….\nOh also I turn 25 this month so a personal goal is to not get weighed down under the ever looming presence of my own mortality :D\nTLDR; Goals are\n\nWrap up proposal\nPlan for potential wet work\nLiterally any sort of start on Ch. 1\n\nCheers!"

At the end of the fourth cycle, more started spawning and added 1 additional 30/30 cycle and a shorter 15/15 cycle which yielded additional males and females for both treatments. Ended with 5 total females available for crossing, est. 5 million eggs/potential larvae. I had to leave early to catch the ferry and didn’t get the final counts though."

Also open house is next weekend so did some prep with Andy for that.\n\n\nMay 12-18\nClass and regularly scheduled programming. Prep for open house, with grace. Went out on a boat (admiral jack!) with Rosalind and Maritime HS. And had the open house which was sick and had over 1200 estimated visitors!\n\n\nMay 19-26\nClass and lab, re installed x tools to finally get my notebook updated. Started previewing some literature to understand enriched biological processes for clam samples. Was out Thursday afternoon through Monday.\n\n\nMay 27th\nWas out of office still, but in the evening continued working on looking at enriched biological processes functions / role in various pathways.\n\n\nMay 28th\nPresentation for 541. Working on going back to the list of DEG and log2fold change to try and tie back the biological processes to try and parse which ones are increasing or decreasing with my samples. Lottttt of debugging and contemplating becoming an off-the-grid nomad so I never have to touch a computer again.\n\n\nMay 29th\nBright and early I went to continue debugging, with little success. Moved on and wrote up the methods for the clam OA stuff from class/lab, refined my figures a bit, and made my presentation for the creative project for class.\n\n\nMay 30\nWrote up speaker notes for my presenation, did some more background literature reading, and prepped a bit for the presentation. Had class (didn’t present) and lab meeting. Found out during lab meeting that the issues I was having with figuring out how to connect DEG, log2fold change, and BP together was really close to the right solution. Steven says that DAVID provides a uniprot accession number associated with each GO term it gives you, and can use that to connect REVIGO output to DEG expression levels."

Luke and Jose on board, just waiting to hear back from Mac and then I’ll send out the docusign form and submit the safs milestone.\nAlso worked on finalizing my manila clam repo, getting the readme docs updated. Forwarded the hisat workflow write up and repo to mac as well.\nTroubleshooted VPN problems to no avail. And still sick so wasn’t able to go into the office…\n\n\nJune 6th\nHeard back from mac and we’re good to go. Finalized manila clam repo and finished updating the readme docs. Submitted final lab assignment.\n\n\nJune 10th\nWent over lurida workflow to date ( just blast) to check outputs and added some visualizations. Started to search for various known (to literature) genes associated with repro (ex. dmrt) to see if present in blast output.

Next steps are to continue to mess around with different filter settings to see what genes persist, and keep updating visualizations.\n\n\nJuly 17th\nWorked on DESeq and Heatmap code to 1) clean it up to make it a bit more clear and 2) refine the heatmaps for each of the analysis so far. Started first readthrough of the rphil manuscript too.\n\n\nJuly 19th\nLight week, but got some technical issues figured out and moved enough of the clam repo local to do some of the less heavy analysis from home again. Finished manuscript read through. Prepped for Chris’ panel next week.\n\n\nJuly 24th\nWent back and reconciled for the missing 193 sample. Redid featurcounts to include 193."
